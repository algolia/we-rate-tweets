## A sample application using Twitter OAuth and Algolia Search. 

### You'll need a few things to get started on your own remix:
- Twitter app to insert your Twitter Consumer Key & Secret, Twitter Access Key & Secret. 
- Algolia account with your search key and app id

### What is this used for?
We use Twitter authenticate a user, on successful authentication of a user we kick off a series of actions prior to bringing the user to a success page with a cookie set.

Once we recieve success with kick of a series of promises with `fetchUserTimeline` that takes the username from the parameters of the successful authentication. This starts a call with a promise to Twitter's `GET_USER_TIMELINE` to grab the users last 200 tweets. Once we successful recieve the timeline, we start resolve with another promise to `pullRelevantData` iterate over each tweet and grab the information we find relevant and build a tweet object. Once this is resolved, we start another promise to `sendTimelineToAlgolia` where we send our consolidated tweets to Algolia to create an index. Upon resolving this function, we start another *final* promise to `setAlgoliaIndexAndSettings` to let Algolia know about our settings, like custom rankings. Now that is complete we resolve our promise we started with in `fetchUserTimeline` and display a search box to the user.
